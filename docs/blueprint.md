## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#B19CD9), reminiscent of amethyst, for a sleek yet approachable feel. The purple symbolizes creativity and innovation.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA) creates a calming and clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale pink (#FADADD) provides gentle contrast to attract the eye to CTAs and important UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a clean and modern look
- Use a set of minimalist vector icons related to blockchain development. Each icon should inherit its color from the primary color to keep the design consistent.
- Use a fluid, grid-based layout to maintain responsiveness across different devices. Provide sufficient whitespace to prevent information overload and content bleeding.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g. a smooth loader when connecting a wallet). Each microinteraction must complement the minimalist feel of the platform.
